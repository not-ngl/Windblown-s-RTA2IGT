- **Spectrogram Visualization** — Audio-based waveform display to quickly locate loading regions
- **Automatic Boundary Expansion** — Expands anchor points into start/end timestamps using color analysis
- **Frame-Accurate Verification** — Keyboard navigation for sub-second precision (30fps video support)
- **Multi-Segment Support** — Process multiple loading times in a single submission
- **Cross-Platform** — Tested on Linux; Windows supported (macOS compatibility pending user reports)
- **Standardized Export** — Generates output files that could be used for quick moderation verification

## Installation

### Linux

```bash
# Get the repo
git clone https://github.com/not-ngl/Windblown-s-RTA2LRT.git
cd Windblown-s-RTA2LRT

# Setup a virtual environment
python3 -m venv [A new virtual environment]
source [A new virtual environment]/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements

# Ensure you have ffmpeg, deno installed
ffmpeg -version 
deno --version 

# Run the GUI
python3 run_gui.py
```

### Windows

#### Step 1: Install Python
Download from `python.org` using the PyInstaller. Ensure to check the box Add Python to PART during the installation process.

#### Step 2: Install ffmpeg
Download from `ffmpeg.org` the latest stable release of ffmpeg. Extract to `C:\ffmpeg`. Add `C:\ffmpeg\bin` to your PATH environment variable.

#### Step 3: Install Deno
Visit https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

#### Step 4: Install this project!
```bash
git clone https://github.com/not-ngl/Windblown-s-RTA2LRT.git 
cd Windblown-s-RTA2LRT
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It is morelikely that you will need to include `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Python\pythoncore-X.Y-N\Scripts` to your PATH.

And finally, run the GUI:
```bash
pytohn3 run_gui.py
```

#### Troubleshooting
Ensure `ffmpeg`, `deno`  executables are in your system PATH. Verify with commands:
```
ffmpeg -version 
deno --version 
```

Ensure to be connected to a YouTube account.

## Usage

1. **Launch the GUI**: `python run_gui.py`
2. **Provide a video** via local file or URL (ensure to select the browser you are using)
3. **Use the Spectrogram** to find loading regions (mark segments where in-game timer is active; they appear quiet/black)
4. **Let the tool auto-detect** the approximate boundaries
5. **Locate precise frames** using h/j/k/l keys to find the first visible purple loading frame
6. **Export** — output files help moderators verify the results
